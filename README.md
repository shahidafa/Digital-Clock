Digital Clock Project

This project showcases a sleek, real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure provides the framework for the clock's display, while CSS styles it with a modern, clean look. 
JavaScript powers the dynamic functionality, updating the time every second to ensure accuracy. The result is a visually appealing and fully functional digital clock that demonstrates fundamental web development skills.
